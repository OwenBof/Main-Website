TODAY I woke up and didn’t go the restaurant today twas so sad. (awwww). It was depressing to realise that it is no longer Laura’s birthday, however it’s christmas eve today!!!!! I really like christmas eve because it means tomorrow is christmas, who would’ve guessed. N e way, what did i do today? Glad u asked! I actually can’t remember. I know that i was probably being summoned by Joe and Jenny because my g0d they’re needy and I’m just SO popular that i need to be present at all times. (u do (party emoji: 🎉)) (especially at 11:30) i really liked staying up until 11:30 with them because i enjoy they’re company and tea cam is where it’s at :D (ngl it is)(it really is!!!). I think that Joe makes the best tea because Jenny doesn’t use the correct mug (top daddy!) (JOE’S WAS JUST SALTY AND I KNOW THIS - imagine putting salt in tea 🤢 JBASFBAKJ) (shush I dON’T PUT SALT IN MY TEA) (smh he’s lying me and jJENNY know just how much of a weirdo this JOE BOYis) Ok what now.
